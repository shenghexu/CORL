# CORL
Code for 'Tomography Based Learning for Load Distribution through Opaque Networks', using critic only reinforcement learning.


### Dependencies
Python 3.5.6  
numpy 1.15.2
Pytorch 1.5.1   
scipy 1.1.0 

### Running the egress picking experiment on Abilene
1. `cd ./Abilene/Original`, then `python3 Original.py --seed_n 0`, this will generate the original delays used by other methods to calculate improvement.
2. Go to other folders and run CORL/CORL-FW/DDPG/FW.
